**Erasing files** from your computer may seem like a simple task, but if you want to make sure they are unrecoverable, there are some things you need to consider.

If your drive is encrypted, then you don't usually need to worry about deleting files; all your data is already impossible to read without the encryption key. An unencryped drive is another story.

For this situation, pressing "delete" on a file isn't enough; this will tell the drive to allow this space to be overwritten, but the data will still be there. You don't know when the data will be overwritten, or even if it will at all. To ensure your files cannot be recovered, you will need to follow these steps:

Spinning Hard Drive: 

SSD: Shut down your computer and enter your computer's UEFI settings. You may need to check your motherboard's manual for which key to press on startup. Usually it's one of the function keys at the top of your keyboard or the delete key. Once in your UEFI settings, there should be an option called "SecureErase." Choosing this will let you safely wipe your drive.

!!! Warning

    The data on your drive will not be recoverable; make sure you have any files you need on a separate drive before performing this action!
